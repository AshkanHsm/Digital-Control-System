# Digital-Control-System

Designing a DC Motor and Measuring and Controlling its Speed with a PWM and a Driver and a Microcontroller and an encoder and a Board.
Goal: The Micro Controller will send the PWM to the Driver and the Driver will work as a Zero-Order hold.
The Zero-Order hold transfers the Digital Signal that was Sent by Micro controller and transforms it to an Analog Signal which would be applied to the DC Motor.
The Encoder can emit Pulses to the Micro Controller and can Measure the rotation speed of DC Motor by counting the holes in the Board that will move in front of it.
